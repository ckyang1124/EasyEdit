# Edited Model Outputs

This folder contains the model outputs before and after editing.

## Notes
- To save time, pre-edit output is only run once. Refer to `MEND/` for pre-edit outputs of DeSTA and Qwen.
- Use `merge_pre_edit.py` to merge pre-edit outputs with post-edit outputs for other algorithms.
